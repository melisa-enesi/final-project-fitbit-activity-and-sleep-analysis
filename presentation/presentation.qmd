## About This Project

-   This presentation summarizes my **Fitbit Activity & Sleep Dashboard** built in R Shiny.
-   Data comes from a public **Fitbit dataset (Kaggle)**.
-   Includes:
    -   Daily activity data\
    -   Sleep data\
    -   Hourly step + calorie data\
-   Main research questions:
    1.  **How is sleep related to calories burned?**
    2.  **How does daily activity vary across users and across the day?**

# Creating Slides

## Goal of This Dashboard

-   To visually explore relationships between:
    -   Sleep duration\
    -   Calories burned\
    -   Step counts\
    -   Activity patterns\
-   To build an **interactive dashboard** using:
    -   Shiny\
    -   Tidyverse\
    -   Leaflet\
    -   ggplot2

## Data Used

-   **dailyActivity_merged.csv**
    -   Total steps, calories, active minutes\
-   **sleepDay_merged.csv**
    -   Minutes asleep, time in bed\
-   **Hourly datasets**
    -   Steps and calories per hour\
-   Data cleaning:
    -   Converted dates\
    -   Joined daily activity + sleep tables\
    -   Calculated averages & summaries

## Dashboard Tabs

-   Sleep vs Calories\
-   Daily Activity\
-   Hourly Patterns\
-   Sleep Details\
-   Each tab includes:
    -   Filters\
    -   Sliders\
    -   Dynamic plots\
    -   Explanatory text

# Slide Content

## Research Question 1

### How is sleep related to calories burned?

### Sleep vs Calories Scatterplot

![Sleep vs Calories](images/Screenshot_2025-12-02_005816.png)

-   Slight upward trend\
-   More sleep → slightly more calories burned\
-   But the relationship is **weak**\
-   Many days with similar sleep but different calorie output

## Sleep Quality & Consistency

![Sleep Quality + Sleep Calendar](images/Screenshot_2025-12-02_005919.png)

-   Sleep quality plot:
    -   Hours asleep falls slightly below hours in bed\
    -   Shows **realistic inefficiencies** in sleep\
-   Sleep consistency calendar:
    -   Displays weekly patterns\
    -   Sleep duration is **fairly stable** overall

## Interpretation (Q1)

-   Weak positive association between sleep and calories burned\
-   Sleep efficiency is moderate\
-   Most users sleep for a large portion of their time in bed\
-   Sleep alone is **not a major predictor** of calorie burn

## Research Question 2

### How do daily activity patterns vary?

### Daily Activity Overview

![Daily Activity](images/Screenshot_2025-12-02_005831.png)

-   Lightly Active minutes dominate\
-   Fairly Active + Very Active minutes are much lower\
-   Step leaderboard:
    -   Users vary widely in total steps per day\
-   Calories vs Steps:
    -   Strong positive relationship\
    -   More steps = more calories burned

## User Consistency in Steps

![User Consistency](images/Screenshot_2025-12-02_005845.png)

-   Coefficient of variation (sd/mean steps)\
-   Shows day-to-day consistency\
-   Many users vary significantly from one day to the next\
-   A few users have very stable routines

## Hourly Activity Patterns

![Hourly Patterns](images/Screenshot_2025-12-02_005907.png)

-   Overnight activity is nearly zero\
-   Activity rises in the morning\
-   Peaks midday and early evening\
-   Weekend midday peaks are **slightly higher**\
-   Indicates flexible schedules on weekends

# Slide Customization

## Interpretation (Q2)

-   Users spend most of their time in **light** physical activity\
-   Step counts vary widely\
-   Strong time-of-day patterns seen across all users\
-   Weekends show slightly higher midday movement\
-   Activity levels are not consistent day to day

## Project Conclusions

-   **Sleep vs Calories**
    -   Weak positive relationship\
    -   Sleep is fairly consistent but not a strong predictor
-   **Daily Activity**
    -   Light activity dominates\
    -   Users differ widely in step counts\
    -   Strong daily cycles
-   **Dashboard**
    -   Allows interactive exploration\
    -   Useful for comparing users and patterns

## Limitations

-   Small user sample\
-   Short tracking period (Mar–May)\
-   No demographic information\
-   Data may not represent entire populations

## Future Improvements

-   Add demographic filters\
-   Integrate more detailed workout logs\
-   Predict calorie expenditure with models\
-   Add personalized health recommendations

## AI Usage Disclosure

- I used AI tools (ChatGPT) **strictly for support**, including:
    - Debugging issues with RMarkdown, Quarto, and image rendering  
    - Clarifying errors and understanding file path problems  
    - Getting guidance on how to structure my presentation and report  
    - Receiving explanations of Shiny components, data joins, and plotting logic
