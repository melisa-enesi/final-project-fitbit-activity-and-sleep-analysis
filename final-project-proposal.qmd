### Project Title

*Predicting Daily Step Counts from Fitness Tracker Data.*

### Data Source

I plan to use a publicly available **Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset** from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>).

The dataset includes daily activity records for 30 users over several months. It contains multiple types of data, including daily activity metrics, sleep logs, weight information, and time-based activity summaries. The main variables are organized below by category:

#### Daily Activity Data

-   `Id`: unique user ID

-   `ActivityDate`: date of record

-   `TotalSteps`: total number of steps taken per day

-   `TotalDistance`: total distance traveled (in miles)

-   `TrackerDistance`: distance recorded by the Fitbit device

-   `LoggedActivitiesDistance`: manually logged distance

-   `VeryActiveDistance`: distance traveled during very active minutes

-   `ModeratelyActiveDistance`: distance traveled during moderate activity

-   `LightActiveDistance`: distance traveled during light activity

-   `SedentaryActiveDistance`: distance during sedentary activity (often `0`)

-   `VeryActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in very active activity

-   `FairlyActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in moderate activity

-   `LightlyActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in light activity

-   `SedentaryMinutes`: number of minutes spent sedentary

-   `Calories`: total calories burned

#### Sleep Data

-   `Id`: user ID (same as above)

-   `SleepDay`: date of sleep record

-   `TotalSleepRecords`: number of distinct sleep logs that night

-   `TotalMinutesAsleep`: total minutes spent asleep

-   `TotalTimeInBed`: total minutes in bed (asleep + awake)

#### Weight and BMI Data

-   `Id`: user ID

-   `Date`: date of log

-   `WeightKg`: weight in kilograms

-   `WeightPounds`: weight in pounds

-   `Fat`: body fat percentage (if available)

-   `BMI`: body mass index

-   `IsManualReport`: whether the weight entry was manually logged

-   `LogId`: unique weight log identifier

#### Hourly and Minute-Level Data

-   `ActivityHour`: timestamp for each hour

-   `StepTotal`: total steps recorded during that hour

-   `Calories`: calories burned during that hour

-   `ActivityMinute`: timestamp for each minute

-   `Intensity`: activity intensity value for that minute

#### Main Datasets:

-   sleepDay_merged.csv

-   weightLogInfo_merged.csv

-   hourlySteps_merged.csv

-   hourlyCalories_merged.csv

-   minuteSleep_merged.csv
