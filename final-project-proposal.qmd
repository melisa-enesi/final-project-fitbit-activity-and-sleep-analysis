### Project Title

Exploring Activity and Sleep Patterns Using Fitbit Data.

### Data Source

I plan to use a publicly available **Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset** from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>).

The dataset includes daily activity records for 30 users over several months. It contains multiple types of data, including daily activity metrics, sleep logs, weight information, and time-based activity summaries. The main variables are organized below by category:

#### Daily Activity Data

-   `Id`: unique user ID

-   `ActivityDate`: date of record

-   `TotalSteps`: total number of steps taken per day

-   `TotalDistance`: total distance traveled (in miles)

-   `TrackerDistance`: distance recorded by the Fitbit device

-   `LoggedActivitiesDistance`: manually logged distance

-   `VeryActiveDistance`: distance traveled during very active minutes

-   `ModeratelyActiveDistance`: distance traveled during moderate activity

-   `LightActiveDistance`: distance traveled during light activity

-   `SedentaryActiveDistance`: distance during sedentary activity (often `0`)

-   `VeryActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in very active activity

-   `FairlyActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in moderate activity

-   `LightlyActiveMinutes`: number of minutes spent in light activity

-   `SedentaryMinutes`: number of minutes spent sedentary

-   `Calories`: total calories burned

#### Sleep Data

-   `Id`: user ID (same as above)

-   `SleepDay`: date of sleep record

-   `TotalSleepRecords`: number of distinct sleep logs that night

-   `TotalMinutesAsleep`: total minutes spent asleep

-   `TotalTimeInBed`: total minutes in bed (asleep + awake)

#### Weight and BMI Data

-   `Id`: user ID

-   `Date`: date of log

-   `WeightKg`: weight in kilograms

-   `WeightPounds`: weight in pounds

-   `Fat`: body fat percentage (if available)

-   `BMI`: body mass index

-   `IsManualReport`: whether the weight entry was manually logged

-   `LogId`: unique weight log identifier

#### Hourly and Minute-Level Data

-   `ActivityHour`: timestamp for each hour

-   `StepTotal`: total steps recorded during that hour

-   `Calories`: calories burned during that hour

-   `ActivityMinute`: timestamp for each minute

-   `Intensity`: activity intensity value for that minute

#### Main Datasets:

-   dailyActivity_merged.csv

-   sleepDay_merged.csv

-   weightLogInfo_merged.csv

-   hourlySteps_merged.csv

-   hourlyCalories_merged.csv

-   minuteSleep_merged.csv

This dataset is clean and detailed, making it a great fit for exploring relationships among physical activity, calories burned, and sleep behavior.

### Research Questions

1.  **Is there a relationship between calories burned and total time spent asleep?**

    This question explores whether higher energy expenditure during the day is associated with longer or shorter sleep durations at night. By comparing daily calorie burn and total minutes asleep, the analysis can reveal patterns in how physical activity influences rest and recovery. Understanding this relationship can also provide insights into how lifestyle habits impact overall well-being.

2.  **Which type of activity—very active, moderately active, or lightly active—has the strongest impact on total daily calorie burn?**

    This question explores how different intensities of movement contribute to overall energy expenditure. While it seems intuitive that very active minutes would burn the most calories, the data may reveal more complex patterns. Because most users spend far more time in light or moderate activity, these lower-intensity movements could play a larger role in total calorie output than expected. Analyzing these patterns will help identify which types of activity are most influential in overall daily energy use.

### Motivation

I’ve always been interested in how data can reflect real human habits, especially when it comes to health and daily life. I started wearing a fitness tracker last year, and I noticed how much information it collects (steps, calories, heart rate, even sleep patterns). It made me curious about what those numbers actually mean beyond the app’s simple charts.

By analyzing Fitbit data, I want to see how lifestyle factors like activity and sleep connect to overall well-being. This project combines my personal interest in health with my growing skills in data science, giving me the chance to interpret real-world data through visualization and statistical analysis.

#### Approach and Methods

-   Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in R using the `tidyverse` packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`) to examine relationships between calories burned, sleep duration, and activity intensity.\
-   Create visualizations such as scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation plots to explore how daily energy expenditure relates to total time asleep and how different activity types contribute to overall calorie burn.\
-   For the first research question, analyze the relationship between `Calories` and `TotalMinutesAsleep` using correlation and regression analysis to determine whether higher daily calorie burn corresponds to longer or shorter sleep durations.\
-   For the second research question, compare the effects of `VeryActiveMinutes`, `FairlyActiveMinutes`, and `LightlyActiveMinutes` on `Calories` to identify which intensity level has the strongest impact on total daily energy use.\
-   Use multiple regression and visualization techniques to highlight calorie efficiency across activity types.\
-   Develop an **interactive R Shiny dashboard** that allows users to explore relationships between activity levels, calories burned, and sleep duration. The dashboard will include dynamic visualizations, filters, and summary statistics to make the findings more accessible and engaging.\
-   Present the final analysis and dashboard through a well-documented Quarto report that integrates code, visuals, and written interpretation.

#### Expected Outcomes

-   Visualizations that reveal how energy expenditure during the day influences total sleep duration.\
-   Comparative analysis showing which activity intensity contributes most strongly to total daily calories burned.\
-   An interactive R Shiny dashboard that enables exploration of daily behavior patterns and their relationships to energy expenditure and sleep.\
-   Quantitative insights into how different forms of physical activity and rest interact to shape overall health behavior.\
-   A clear, reproducible workflow that demonstrates effective use of R, Quarto, and Shiny for real-world data analysis.

#### Proposal Meeting Preparation

I will bring this short summary and be prepared to discuss the dataset, variables, and updated research questions during the November 14 proposal meeting.
